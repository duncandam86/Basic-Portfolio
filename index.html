        <p>I was born in the USSR when my parents were pursuing their education. 
            We moved back to Vietnam when I was less than 6 months old.
            I grew up in Vietnam until I was 8 years old and moved to Australia with my dad.
            At 14 years old, I received a scholarship to attend a boarding school in London so 
            I packed my bag and moved across the globe. After spending 5 years in London, a new adventure was calling
            my name, so again I moved across the globe to America to pursue further education.
            I moved to Chicago in 2009 to start my PhD at Northwestern and have been at the institution since then as a student, fellow and now
            an assistant professor.
